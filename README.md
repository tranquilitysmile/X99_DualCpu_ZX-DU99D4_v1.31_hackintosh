## Before start

- MacOS have CPU Core limit (64 cores) in my case with x2 Intel Xeon E5 2699 v3, i disable 2 core on both CPU in bios, without it system can't boot
- Don't forget generate and set in config.plist you own MLB/Serial etc 
- You should use exactly same bios settings like in repo BIOS folder, most of problem with booting installer and system in bios settings
- For working WiFi/BT/Airdrop etc...you should use OpenCore Legacy Patcher Developers builds from https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher
- I use self made bios mod with -50mv undervolting and turbo boost unlock, but it's not necessary to start the system

**macOS version**: 15 beta 4

**OpenCore version**: 1.1

**SMBIOS**:  iMacPro1,1

## Working
- Everything except sleep/wake (can't work on X99 platform with dual cpu)
